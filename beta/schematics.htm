<p>Penguin Telecom's personnel have expert-level experience with getting symbols built and with schematic capture.  Unlike traditional methods, our method avoids manual entry when possible and provides checks when not.  Our flow includes:
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Symbol generation by Perl-based manipulation of vendor data sheets.  All symbols are reviewed to conform to engineering conventions, intelligent pin grouping and customer guidelines.
<li>100% checking of legacy or otherwise unverified symbols.  Automated methods to find missing and duplicate pins in two or three minutes instead of an hour on parts with 500+ pins.
<li>Use of hierarchy and Configuration Management tools to support more than one engineer working on a schematic.
<li>Definition of schematic naming rules before starting schematic entry to reduce integration problems.
<li>Reviewing all DRC warnings to find the real ones among the inevitable numerous false positives.
<li>Holding targeted design reviews looking over the whole schematic in depth as well as avoiding missing subtle problems.
</ul>
<p>

While our personnel have used various tools, we especially excel at working with Cadence OrCAD CIS.
<p>
We know that our designs must work right the first time, and we produce schematics accordingly.
<hr>
Some Schematic Capture Handoff Tips:
<ol>
<li>Check for nets with more than about 8 connections.  Often high connectivity on non-power nets represents an error when a slight mouse move shorts nets together
<li>Check for nets with similar but different names (e.g. RSTN and RST_N).  If both nets have connections, a DRC typically won't find this problem.
<li>After the schematic is frozen, perform schematic differences to ensure what changed is only what was supposed to.  Moving a net and shorting to another is a common source of errors.
<li>Make sure parts' values haven't been changed without updating the part number.  This error will often result in incorrectly built boards.
</ol>
Penguin Telecom has semi-automated methods for checking for these and related problems.  We can also support outsourcing of your symbol generation process.  Give us an <a href="mailto:bdc@penguintelecom.com">e-mail</a>.
